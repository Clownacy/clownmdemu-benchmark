# clownmdemu-benchmark

This is a benchmarking tool for my Mega Drive emulator. It measures
how long the emulator takes to run a given game for a given number of
frames.

This is useful for identifying performance improvements and
regressions during development, as well as comparing the performance
of the emulator on various platforms.
